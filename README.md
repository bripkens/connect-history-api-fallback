# history-api-fallback [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback)

Single page applications typically only have one file that is directly
accessible by web browsers: The `index.html`. Navigation in the application
is then commonly handled using JavaScript with the help of the
[HTML 5 history API](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#the-history-interface).
This results in issues when the user hits the refresh button or is directly
accessing a page other than the landing page, e.g. `/impress` or
`/bripkens/history-api-fallback`, as the web server is then trying to retrieve
a file which is existing at this location. As your application is a SPA, the
web server will fail trying to retrieve the file and return a *404 - Not Found*
message to the user.

This tiny middleware addresses some of the issues. Specifically, it will change
the requested location to `index.html` whenever there is a request which
fulfils the following criteria:

 1. The request is a GET request
 2. which accepts `text/html` and
 3. is not a direct file request, i.e. the requested path does not contain a `.` (DOT) character.
 
Note: the last rule can be overwritten by the `fallbackToIndexForUrlsWithDots` configuration (see last use case below).

## Usage

The middleware is available through NPM and can easily be added.

```
npm install --save connect-history-api-fallback
```

Now you only need to add the middleware to your application like so

```javascript
var connect = require('connect');
var historyApiFallback = require('connect-history-api-fallback');

var app = connect()
  .use(historyApiFallback)
  .listen(3000);
```

Of course you can also use this piece of middleware with express:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var historyApiFallback = require('connect-history-api-fallback');

var app = express();
app.use(historyApiFallback);
```

Activate logging of rewrite reasons:

```javascript
var historyApiFallback = require('connect-history-api-fallback');
historyApiFallback.setLogger(console.log.bind(console));

var app = express();
app.use(historyApiFallback);
```

Support URLs with dots:

```javascript
var historyApiFallback = require('connect-history-api-fallback');

var appBaseDirectory = './app'; // Application Base directory

var app = express();
app.use(historyApiFallback.fallbackToIndexForUrlsWithDots(true, appBaseDirectory)); 
```
